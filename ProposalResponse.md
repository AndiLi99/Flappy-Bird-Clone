# Group 11 - Flappy Bird

## Tentative Rating
Above Average for _complete product_. Average for flappy bird with regular controls and not beautiful output (flappy bird isn't actually that complicated to implement in principle).

## Comments
 - Look forward to it. I think we already chatted about this. Start simple, then beautify!
 - Noise will be a problem when using clapping but at least clapping is a loud distinct sound, so good choice.
 - How do you intend to generate the infinitely long map? :-)
